  <h1>The Wonders of Photovoltaic Systems</h1>
  <h2>There are several different parts of a solar system.</h2>

    <h3>Solar Panels</h3>
    <article>Photovoltaic solar panels absorb sunlight as a source of energy to generate electricity. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a packaged, connected assembly of typically 6x10 photovoltaic solar cells. Photovoltaic modules constitute the photovoltaic array of a photovoltaic system that generates and supplies solar electricity in commercial and residential applications.</article>

    <h3>Solar Storage Battery</h3>
    <article>One of the best ways to put a solar PV system with battery backup to good use is to charge up the batteries during peak photovoltaic times and then use the stored electricity when the sun is down. The result is less dependence on power provided by the local utility and the monthly bill that comes with it.</article>

    <h3>Inverter</h3>
    <article>A solar inverter or PV inverter, is a type of electrical converter which converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into a utility frequency alternating current (AC) that can be fed into a commercial electrical grid or used by a local, off-grid electrical network. It is a critical balance of system (BOS)â€“component in a photovoltaic system, allowing the use of ordinary AC-powered equipment.</article>

    <h3>Net Meter</h3>
    <article>Net metering (or net energy metering, NEM) allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime, instead of when it is generated. This is particularly important with renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which are non-dispatchable (when not coupled to storage). Monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night, or wind from a windy day later in the month.</article>
